% Dr. Corey Stephan's CV

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Dr. Bastian Rieck's LaTeX CV, on which I have based my own (by customizing his template, which is available here: https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/latex-cv), requires multiple external fonts to be installed and the use of the fontspec package to load them. I intend for my own CV, however, to be compilable with any full TeXLive installation (on GNU/Linux or *BSD) via LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX as-is. Hence, for example, I strictly use the old-style and proportional variant of Dr. Edward Tufte's book font, ET Book, which is now included in TeXLive as the {ETbb} package. %

% This is the simplest class to start with. You may want to change the
% paper format or the standard font size.
\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{article}

\usepackage				[USenglish]{babel}      			% American English justifications, hyphenations, etc.

\usepackage         	{fontawesome} 					% Symbols/icons
\usepackage 			[oldstyle,proportional]{ETbb}	% ET Book, oldstyle and proportional

% Change this depending on your own preferences. I personally prefer
% nice ligatures and 'old style' numbers. Additionally, the way each
% font is set up ensures that the layout is very uniform---mostly, I
% achieve this effect using `MatchLowercase`.
%
% TODO: Make sure you select a font with small caps here, unless you
% also change the section style. See below.
